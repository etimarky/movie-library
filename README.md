# movie-library
```
This project loads API data from various streaming services onto a server. A basic http server is created and loads the data that is retrieved from the specific API call. An API object is also created that will be used in our movie-app to call for specific genres and movie/series information.
```
## Project setup
```
1. Run npm init to set up a new or existing npm package
2. Run npm install to download dependencies
3. Run npm install http to create the server
4. Run npm install axios for API calls
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
Currently, running node index.js within the ./server folder will run the function
and display this within localhost:8080
```

### Compiles and minifies for production - currently not in use
```
npm run build
```
