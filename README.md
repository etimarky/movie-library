# movie-library
```
This project uses Express to create servers to post data. This data is used for the Movie App to function properly. 
This was used to populate a database with the Netflix data as well.

Run this project along with the github https://github.com/etimarky/movie-app and a database with the approx. rest API data. 
The Movie App will be fully functioning alongside Movie Library.

The rest API used is from https://rapidapi.com/movie-of-the-night-movie-of-the-night-default/api/streaming-availability/.
